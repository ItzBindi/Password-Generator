# Password-Generator


## Description


My motivation for this project was me thinking about all my passwords and wondering if they could be easily cracked. So I built this project to create passwords that would be hard to crack. Having a password at random that has nothing to do with you makes it so much harder for someone to try and access your accounts. With this anyone trying to access your accounts would have a really hard time trying to figure out and random combination of lower and upper case letters along with numbers and special characters.
 I learned how to implement if statements and loops in javascript along with creating variables and array and functions and putting them to use.



## Installation

No installation needed just load up the site with this link: https://itzbindi.github.io/Password-Generator/

## Usage

When the page first loads up you will see a red button saying "Generate Password". Once you click that you will be show a prompt asking you to pick a password length bewteen 8 to 128 characters. Enter your desired length and press ok. Next you will be asked if you want lowercase characters in your password. Select ok for yes or cancel for no. The same process for the next questions. Once done in the box above the generate password button your new password will be posted in the box.
